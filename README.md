# JPDB KanjiVG Image Replacer

Replaces the default kanji images on JPDB.io with kanji images from KanjiVG.

The default kanji images are in a typeface style, which is not optimal for learning to write the kanji by hand.
The replacement images follow the handwriting style found in Japanese schoolbooks.

This user script is also shared on [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/476944-jpdb-kanjivg-image-replacer).

## Known issues

- Doesn't work well with JPDB:s dark mode due to the images being black. I recommend using light mode because of this.
- The replacement image is smaller than the default. I wasn't able to scale the image up.

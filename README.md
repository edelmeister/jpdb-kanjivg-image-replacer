# JPDB KanjiVG Image Replacer

Replaces the default kanji images on [jpdb.io](https://jpdb.io/) with kanji images from KanjiVG.

The default kanji images are in a typeface style, which is not optimal for learning to write the kanji by hand.
The replacement images follow the handwriting style found in Japanese schoolbooks.

## Installation

1. Add Tampermonkey (or equivalent) to your browser extensions.
2. Go to [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/476944-jpdb-kanjivg-image-replacer) and press install script.
3. First time using the script, Tampermonkey will ask for your permission to run it.
4. (optional: Disable/enable the script and refresh the page if it isn't working.)

## Known issues

- Doesn't work well with JPDB:s dark mode due to the images being black. I recommend using light mode because of this.
- Sometimes the image isn't replaced when doing reviews.
